NEEDS FIXED:
- Changing back to the list view or map view the wrong object container is displayed (Fragment is loaded too soon!)
- need to find an event which happens after our UI has been loaded.

STARTED ON:
- Add map to display user selected types (Checkboxes)

TODO SHITE:
Final touches to the list:
- Modify card to make information more easily read (Split text into sections)

After finished portrait version:
- Start work on a landscape version
- For the map possible show the current incidents as a sidebar list if the screen is large enough


Final checks:
- Add headers to each JAVA file
- Add headers to each view (if not added)
