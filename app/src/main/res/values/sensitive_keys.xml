      TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

      To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:
      https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=55:9F:80:5F:7F:06:22:18:53:2C:61:29:A2:3A:97:A8:19:E3:22:FD%3Bcom.marcwaugh.s1829721.mpdcw2

      You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

      Package name:
        com.marcwaugh.s1829721.mpdcw2

      SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
        55:9F:80:5F:7F:06:22:18:53:2C:61:29:A2:3A:97:A8:19:E3:22:FD

      Alternatively, follow the directions here:
      https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

      string in this file.
